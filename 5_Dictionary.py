# IMPORTANT RÄ°MENDERS

# The used methods used were also used in list structures.
# When we add new item the key writes in [].
# When we delete any item the key writes in [].
# When we change any value information the key writes in [].
# The clear() method deletes all items in the dictionary but the del() method just deletes the dictionary
